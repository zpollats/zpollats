## Hi there! 👋🏼

**My name is Zach Pollatsek** and I'm a data scientist with a background in mechanical engineering and entrepreneurship; I also recently graduated from the Flatiron School for Data Science. I worked as a product design engineer for a few years before realizing that I want to pursue a career in technology. I am now seeking a job that challenges me in the world of artificial intelligence and machine learning. 

I became a data scientist because I love to discover patterns in data. I also entered this space because I realized how much untapped data there is in the world around us just waiting to be analyzed!

### What I'm up to:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on [Continuing My Capstone Project](https://github.com/zpollats/CapstoneContinued.git)
- 🌱 I’m currently growing my Python and Cloud skills
- 👯 Open to collaborate on data and machine learning projects that seek to answer complex questions to improve sales for businesses
- 💬 Ask me about neural networks for image classification with Keras/Tensorflow
- 🏜 Salt Lake City, UT based
- 🧘 Hobbies: I love to get outside and go climbing, hiking, and skiing! I've recently become a certified yoga instructor as well. I am also an avid technology fan; I keep up to date with all of the latest in tech when it comes to cybersecurity, E-commerce, and fintech.
